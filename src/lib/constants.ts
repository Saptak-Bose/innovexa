    desc: "We design and ship hardware + software that turns repetitive sequences into a single, elegant action ‚Äî tactile devices, smart firmware, and cloud-backed profiles that make daily workflows feel frictionless. At our core we‚Äôre makers: industrial designers, firmware engineers and UX thinkers who obsess over form, feel and the tiny details that make tools delightful. Our first flagship product, MarX, is a handcrafted macropad built for creators and professionals ‚Äî but Innoùí±exa is the studio, the design language, and the evolving ecosystem behind it.",

    qn: "Why did we create Innoùí±exa?",
    main: "Because time is the most valuable resource ‚Äî and we wanted to give it back.",
    desc: "We watched skilled people waste minutes (then hours) on repeated clicks, menu dives and keystroke tangles. The result felt avoidable: better tooling, not just better software. So we asked: what if the most common, repetitive actions lived under your fingers as a satisfying, single press? Innoùí±exa was born from that question. We aim to translate thoughtful hardware design and simple, powerful software into everyday efficiency ‚Äî designing products that respect craft, speed and delight. We build tools for people who care about doing the work well, not wrestling with their tools.",

    qn: "What will Innoùí±exa produce next?",
    main: "MarX is only the beginning ‚Äî Innoùí±exa will become a family of focused tools that reclaim time across creative and technical workflows.",
    desc: "Expect more devices that solve specific pain points: compact controllers for editors, programmable surfaces for designers, tactile stream decks for producers, and modular accessories that snap into existing setups. Each product will share the same DNA ‚Äî premium materials, low-latency firmware, cloud profile sync, and membership-driven benefits (exclusive drops, AI-assisted macros, and priority support). Alongside hardware, we‚Äôll expand the software platform: smarter macro suggestions, cross-device profile orchestration, and an open marketplace where creators can share and remix workflows. In short: one thoughtful product at a time, Innoùí±exa will build an ecosystem that turns repetitive work into single, beautiful interactions.",
